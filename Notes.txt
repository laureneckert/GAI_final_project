Topic: Use transfer learning to apply artistic genre styles to a personal photograph. The model will be ResNet and the art dataset will be ArtBench-10. If not successful at applying the style transfer, we can scale back the project to something simpler too.

Edit: We will be using CycleGAN as a model instead of ResNet. The photo dataset will be ImageNet.

Environment set up:
